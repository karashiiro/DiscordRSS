# DiscordRSS
A simple bot that pumps RSS feeds into channels. It checks for feed updates every minute.

## Installation

Make sure you have a bot token for the Discord API.

Download the program and Node.js v10+, and run `npm install` to set it up. Then just run the batch file or `node .` to start it.

## Usage

Subscribe the current channel to a feed:
`^subscribe <RSS URL>`

Unsubscribe the current channel from a feed:
`^unsubscribe <RSS URL>`

Subscribe a channel to a feed:
`^subscribe <channel> <RSS URL>`

Unsubscribe a channel from a feed:
`^unsubscribe <channel> <RSS URL>`

Feeds are saved in `rss/`, so you can delete them manually if you want to (make sure to restart the bot if you do it this way!).
